## Using technology to disseminate verified information to the public
![HealthIT Hackathon Day 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67046382/86454753-650e5100-bd28-11ea-8855-5a0dffb62b0a.png)

There has been an increase in misinformation about COVID-19, 
and as a result, the majority of Community Health Workers 
apply myths and misconceptions conceived by members of the
public. As Information Technology enthusiasts, there is a 
need to showcase how technology can be used to disseminate
and enhance the spread of verified information about COVID-19
on key subject areas; Detection of basic symptoms, handling 
infected persons, and managing stress/trauma among the 
front line health workers.
